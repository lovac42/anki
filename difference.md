# Differences with anki.
This files list the difference between regular anki and this forked
version. It also lists the different options in the Preferences's extra page.

## Change type of a note without a full sync (1564281585)
This is not activated by default, because it may causes problem if you
edit the note while it is not synchronized to it's new note type. So I
want to ensure that doing so is your responsibility.
